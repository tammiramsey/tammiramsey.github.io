            <div class="row">
            <h2>Building Brothers for Life</h2>
                <p>At the heart of my campaign lies a fundamental principle: <strong> Building Brothers for Life </strong>. This isn't
                merely a catchy slogan; <strong><em>it's a deeply held belief that the bonds of brotherhood forged within Kappa Kappa Psi extend
                    far beyond the conferral of a degree </em></strong>. It represents a lifelong journey, a continuous commitment to shared
                values, mutual support, and personal growth. My vision is to cultivate an environment where students can fully embrace
                their authentic selves within the Fraternity, allowing the core tenets of Kappa Kappa Psi to resonate and influence
                every aspect of their lives beyond their collegiate years. Furthermore, I aim to reignite the passion of our alumni,
                encouraging them to remain deeply connected to our Fraternity, to continue their personal and professional journey with
                us, and to actively mentor and champion the emerging generation of student leaders and musicians.
                </p>

            <div class="row">
            <h2>Cultivating a Culture of Belonging: The VPME Mindset</h2>    
                <p>As an educator, I am acutely aware that while content is crucial, the emotional experience of our members is paramount.
                The substance of our programs and initiatives holds significance, but what truly leaves a lasting impact is how
                individuals feel. <strong> My aspiration is that every membership candidate, upon reflection, will describe their
                    experience as one where they felt genuinely seen, unequivocally supported, deeply connected to their peers, and
                    fully prepared to become an engaged and contributing member of their chapter </strong>. This profound sense of
                belonging and readiness is the ultimate measure of our success. This guiding mindset will inform every decision, every
                initiative, and every interaction I undertake as Vice President of Membership Education (VPME). It is through this lens
                that we will ensure that our brotherhood is not just a fleeting collegiate experience, but a transformative and enduring
                bond that enriches lives for a lifetime.</p>

            <div>
            <h2>Elevating VPMs and Expanding Our Reach</h2>
                <p>I‚Äôm committed to supporting chapter Vice Presidents for Membership in meaningful and tangible ways. One of my goals is
                to develop a <strong>VPM Toolkit</strong>‚Äîa collaborative resource that draws on the incredible experience of our alumni
                educators, as well as the feedback from working with the district VPMs. This toolkit will be more than just a collection
                of documents; it will be a dynamic, collaborative resource, meticulously crafted to equip VPMs with everything they need
                to succeed.
                <br>
                <br>
                The foundation of this toolkit will be built upon the incredible wealth of experience held by our alumni educators.
                Their years of dedication and insight offer an invaluable resource that we must actively leverage. In addition, the
                toolkit will be continuously refined through direct feedback from working with district VPMs. Their on-the-ground
                perspectives are crucial for ensuring the toolkit is practical, relevant, and addresses real-world challenges.
                <br>
                <br>
                This initiative is directly inspired by my previous work on the National Curriculum Committee, particularly in the
                creation of the Activity Database. That experience demonstrated the power of a centralized, accessible resource in
                standardizing quality and fostering creativity. Similarly, the VPM Toolkit will serve as a central hub for best
                practices and innovative strategies.
                <br>
                <br>
                Furthermore, <strong> as an organization, we must proactively tap into the abundant resources we already possess
                </strong>. The Founder's Circle, for instance, represents a deep reservoir of institutional knowledge and historical
                context that can inform and enrich the toolkit. By integrating these existing assets, we ensure the toolkit is not just
                new, but also deeply rooted in our organization's values and history.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong> Ultimately, my aim is to provide chapter leaders with the right tools to transform theoretical lessons into
                    truly memorable, mission-driven experiences for their members </strong>. With the VPM Toolkit, we can foster a
                culture of excellence, empower our leaders, and ultimately strengthen the bonds within our chapters, ensuring our
                mission thrives for years to come.
                <br>
                <br>
                I‚Äôm also excited to lead expansion efforts by continuing Dr. Nic Rorrer's Friends and Advocates initiative, as well as
                his stated goals of working with the other professional organizations that share our goals and values. I believe that by
                working with organizations such as the National Association for Music Education (NaFME), we can continue to help the
                future generations of college and university band members when they are beginners. NaFME‚Äôs educational standards focus
                on the action words of ‚ÄòCreating, Performing, Responding‚Äô ‚Äî actions I believe we can do within Kappa Kappa Psi. We can
                also rely more heavily on the work of the Chapter Sponsor Committee and the alumni of the Fraternity who have close
                relationships with college and university band programs on campuses where Kappa Kappa Psi may not yet have a presence.
                <br>
                <br>
                We need to focus on building chapters that are thoughtful, inclusive, and sustainable. <strong>Countless student musicians are
                waiting to find a home like Kappa Kappa Psi. Let‚Äôs go meet them where they are!</strong>

            <h2>Strengthening the Road to Wisdom</h2>
            
                <p>During my time on the National Curriculum Development Committee, including serving as Chair, I helped guide the
                development of two new lessons: <em>Our Diversity Matters </em> and <em>Our Sisters Matter</em>. The former was a formal
                charge from President Jessica Lee to the committee; the latter emerged organically from honest, necessary conversations.
                While working on <em>Our Sisters Matter</em>, I worked closely with the Tau Beta Sigma National Curriculum Chair to
                reflect the accuracy and integrity of the lesson. For <em>Our Diversity Matters </em>, I worked with both the Chair and
                Vice Chair of the DEIA Committee, Robert Bratcher and Jayar Brenner, respectively, to get their input and feedback on
                the lesson. Both lessons represent how responsive our curriculum must be to the changing realities of our students and
                society.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Road to Wisdom provides a solid foundation. Still, it‚Äôs time to build on this by collaborating with the National
                Curriculum Committee*, soliciting feedback from chapter Vice Presidents for Membership, and engaging with alumni
                educators of our Fraternity to develop a VPM Toolkit. I want to ensure our membership education remains relevant,
                inclusive, and engaging, so membership candidates are ready to lead and serve from the moment they‚Äôre initiated.
                <br>
                <br>
                *<em>I realize that President-Elect Rorrer‚Äôs vision includes a rebranding of our current national committee structure. I
                    am using the current vocabulary for these committees, knowing that the vision I‚Äôve outlined above may need to be
                    realigned to those newly named or constructed committees</em>. </p>
</p>
            </div>
           
            <div>  
            <h2>Leadership That Listens</h2>
                <p>During my time as North Central District Governor, I worked closely with both district officers and chapter leaders, and
                I saw the heart of this Fraternity in every conversation. <strong>That experience reaffirmed my belief that leadership
                    is not about having all the answers‚Äîit‚Äôs about asking the right questions, listening deeply, and creating change
                    <em>with</em> people, not <em>for</em> them</strong>. By working with both the Chapter Operations (‚ÄòCHOPS‚Äô) and the
                Data and Assessment Committees, we can work to gather pieces of data that can be analyzed into actionable information.
                Another important thing I‚Äôd like to emphasize here is that when developing a feedback loop, those who offered feedback
                need to know they‚Äôve been listened to. Working with the other members of the National Council and the Communications
                Committee, I plan on communicating those pieces of feedback and actionable steps to the Fraternity as a whole.
                </p>
            </div>

            
            <div>
            <h2>Why I'm Running</h2>    
                <p>As a proud alumna, Life Member, and experienced educator, I‚Äôm running because I believe Kappa Kappa Psi is at a pivotal
                moment as we face changes and challenges on college campuses in funding cuts and enrollment decreases. This moment is
                one where we can reimagine how we educate, include, and grow.
                <br>
                <br>
                I bring to this role a vision rooted in engagement, innovation, and servant leadership‚Äîvalues I live out in both my
                career and my Brotherhood. I‚Äôm passionate about creating spaces where members feel seen, heard, and empowered from Day
                One. I believe serving as Vice President for Membership Education is the role that can help make that vision a reality.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Let‚Äôs Build the Future‚ÄîTogether</h2>
            <p>I believe that the next phase of Kappa Kappa Psi requires courageous, compassionate leadership. I‚Äôm ready to serve with
            integrity, humility, and energy‚Äîand I‚Äôm ready to build with you. </p>
                <br>
                <br>
            <h3>Vision: A Fraternity That Builds Brothers for Life ‚Äî and for Leadership</h3>
               <p>My vision for the National Presidency is rooted in one idea: Building Brothers for Life. That means creating a
            Fraternity that doesn‚Äôt just develop students for college leadership ‚Äî it equips them to lead meaningful, values-driven
            lives beyond graduation. <strong>Brotherhood should not be a moment; it should be a movement </strong> ‚Äî one that
            extends from a member‚Äôs first lesson in the Road to Wisdom to their continued journey as alumni, educators, musicians,
            and professionals. 
            <br>
            <br>
            As Vice President for Membership and Expansion, my focus is on empowering candidates from Day One, strengthening the
            bonds between chapters and their sponsors, and making membership education more inclusive, engaging, and lifelong. These
            efforts are foundational for the work I hope to continue as National President. </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>As President, I will:</h3>
            <span class="fratstory-list">

                    <li>
                    ‚≠ê Strengthen the Brotherhood pipeline by connecting student leaders to alumni mentors, resources, and long-term
                        opportunities. ‚≠ê

                    <li>

                    <li>
                    ‚≠ê Support the next VPME in continuing to develop an inclusive curriculum, making sure every Brother sees themselves
                    reflected in our lessons, leadership, and Ritual. ‚≠ê

                    <li>
                    ‚≠ê Champion communication and transparency, ensuring every member, no matter their level of involvement, feels informed,

        </span>
        
        
            <p>I believe in leadership that doesn‚Äôt end with a term or a title. My goal is to ensure that <br>every Brother
             ‚Äî <strong>past,
            present, and future</strong> ‚Äî feels like they still have a place in Kappa Kappa Psi. That‚Äôs how we build a Fraternity that
            lasts. <strong>That‚Äôs how we build Brothers for life.</strong></p>
