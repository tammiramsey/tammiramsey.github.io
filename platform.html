    <title>Tammi Ramsey - Candidate for Vice President for Membership & Expansion</title>

    <main>
        <div class="fratstory">
            <h1 class="frat">My Platform</h1>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
            <h2>Why I'm Running</h2>
                <p>I’m excited to announce my candidacy for Vice President for Membership and Expansion for the 2025–2027 biennium. As a
                proud alumna, Life Member, and experienced educator, I’m running because I believe Kappa Kappa Psi is at a pivotal
                moment—one where we can reimagine how we educate, include, and grow.
                <br>
                <br>
                I bring to this role a vision rooted in <strong>engagement, innovation, and servant leadership</strong>—values I live out in both my
                career and my Brotherhood. I’m passionate about creating spaces where members feel seen, heard, and empowered from Day
                One, and I believe VPME is the role that can help make that vision a reality.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="row">
            <h2>Strengthening the Road to Wisdom</h2>    
                <p>During my time on the National Curriculum Development Committee, including serving as Chair, I helped guide the
                development of two new lessons: <em>Our Diversity Matters</em> and <em>Our Sisters Matter</em>. One was a formal charge to the committee;
                the other emerged organically from honest, necessary conversations. While working on <em>Our Sisters Matter</em>, I worked
                closely with the Tau Beta Sigma National Curriculum Chair to reflect the 
                accuracy and integrity of the lesson. Both represent how responsive our curriculum must be
                to the changing realities of our students and society.
                <br> 
                <br>
                The Road to Wisdom gives us a solid foundation—but it’s time to build on that. I want to ensure our membership education
                remains <strong>relevant, inclusive, and engaging</strong>, so membership candidates are ready to lead and serve from the moment they’re initiated.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div>
            <h2>Building Brothers for Life</h2>
                <p>One of the guiding ideas in my campaign is this: <strong>Building Brothers for Life</strong>. Brotherhood doesn’t end with a degree—it’s
                a lifelong journey. I want to help students bring their full selves into Kappa Kappa Psi, and take the values of our
                Fraternity into every space they enter beyond college. I want to inspire alumni of our Fraternity to stay connected,
                to continue their journey with us, and to support the next generation of student leaders and musicians.
                <br>
                <br>
                As an educator, I know that content matters—but what matters even more is how people feel. <strong> If a membership candidate walks away
                from their experience feeling seen, supported, and connected, then we’ve done our job </strong>. That mindset will shape
                everything I do as VPME.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
            <h2>Elevating VPMs and Expanding Our Reach</h2>
            
                <p>I’m committed to supporting chapter Vice Presidents for Membership in meaningful and tangible ways. One of my goals is
                to develop a <strong>VPM Toolkit</strong>—a collaborative resource that draws on the incredible experience of our alumni educators.
                This is inspired by my work on the National Curriculum Committee when creating the Activity Database. With
                the right tools, we can help chapter leaders turn lessons into memorable, mission-driven experiences.
                <br>
                <br>
                I’m also excited to lead expansion efforts by continuing Dr. Nic Rorrer's <strong>Friends and Advocates</strong> initiative. 
                We need to focus on building chapters that are <strong>thoughtful, inclusive, and sustainable</strong>. Countless student musicians
                are waiting to find a home like Kappa Kappa Psi. Let’s go meet them where they are.
</p>
            </div>
           
            <div>  
            <h2>Leadership That Listens</h2>
                <p>During my time as North Central District Governor, I worked closely with both district officers and chapter leaders, and
                I saw the heart of this Fraternity in every conversation. That experience reaffirmed my belief that leadership is not
                about having all the answers—it’s about asking the right questions, listening deeply, and creating change <em>with</em> people,
                not <em>for</em> them.
                </p>
            </div>

            
            <div>
            <h2>Let’s Build the Future—Together</h2>    
                <p>I believe that the next phase of Kappa Kappa Psi requires courageous, compassionate leadership. I’m ready to serve with
                integrity, humility, and energy—and I’m ready to build with you.
                <br>
                <br>
                Let’s grow our membership.
                Let’s create meaningful education.
                Let’s build Brothers for life!
                </p>
