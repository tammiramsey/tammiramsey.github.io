                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <p class="frat">I am a proud member of the <strong>Zeta Omicron chapter</strong> of Kappa Kappa Psi
                        at the
                        <strong>University of Akron </strong> in Akron, Ohio. I joined in the spring of 2007 and have
                        been
                        actively involved ever since. I have served as the <strong>Vice President for Service, Alumni
                            Relations
                            Officer,
                            and Chapter President</strong>. During my undergraduate studies, I also served as
                        <strong>North
                            Central District
                            President</strong> from 2010-2011, and served as Chair of the <strong>Ritual and Regalia
                            Committee</strong> in 2009,
                        Chair of the <strong>History and Traditions Committee</strong> in 2011. It was during this time
                        as an active student
                        that I have the opportunity to travel to several district and national events, meet many
                        Brothers from around the country, and
                        continue to grow as a leader. Many of the relationships that I now have with Brothers started as
                        <strong> admiration of their leadership</strong>,
                        asking them questions about how they got to where they were, and how I could continue to grow as
                        a leader myself.
                        I am proud to say that many of these Brothers are still my close friends, that I still look up
                        to, and <strong> call upon openly
                            when I need advice or support </strong>, as our Ritual calls for us to do.

                    <p class="frat">After graduating with degrees in Adolescent Young Adult Social Studies Education
                        and History from UA, I continued to <strong> seek out ways to serve both my community and the
                            Fraternity</strong>.
                        It was also during this time that I moved to North Carolina to begin my teaching career.
                        The first opportunity to serve Kappa Kappa Psi came in 2013, when I was asked to assist the
                        petitioning group, which
                        at the time was known as a 'colony', as their advisor. During the 2013-2014 academic
                        school year, I served as Advisor to the group at <strong>Elizabeth City State
                            University</strong>
                        in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, as they were installed as the <strong>Nu Iota</strong>
                        Chapter.
                        It was during this time <strong> I took notes and provided feedback about the process and
                            ways in which I felt it could be improved</strong>, such as not relying on neighboring
                        chapters to provide
                        instruction on the Fraternity's lessons or perform the Ritual, as it proved to be an unfair
                        burden
                        to ask chapters who were not immediately nearby.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="frat"> In 2014, my husband Preston and I moved back home to Ohio, where I continued my career
                    as a
                    social studies teacher at <strong> Washington High School</strong> in Washington Court House, Ohio.
                    During this time,
                    I also continued to coach high school softball and began coaching girl's soccer, which allowed me to
                    continue to build my
                    leadership skills and <strong> work with
                        students outside of the classroom to develop their athletic and leadership skills</strong>.
                    While teaching, I
                    also worked in small ways, as many teachers do, to build trusting relationships with my students,
                    and found many
                    to be in want of basic things, such as mending a hole in their clothing, a snack, or simply an adult
                    who would listen. It was from
                    these conversations that I learned that many of my students were struggling with mental health
                    issues, and that they
                    needed <strong>someone to talk to, someone who would listen, and someone who would help them find
                        the
                        resources
                        they needed</strong>.

                        <p class="frat"> In the summer of 2016, National President Jack D. Lee asked me to serve as the
                            <strong>North Central District Governor</strong>. I was honored to be asked to serve in this
                            capacity, and I took my role very seriously. Applying what I already do in my classroom to
                            the role,
                            I worked hard to build relationships with the chapters in the district and to help them grow
                            and
                            thrive. During this time, along with the other Governors I served
                            with, I worked to revamp the district's website and social media presence, create a more
                            reflective
                            and inclusive process for the district's awards, specifically the Governor's Cup, and
                            continued to
                            work to cultivate the leadership skills of the district officers. It was during my <strong>
                                seven
                                year</strong> tenure
                            as North Central District Governor that a new position was created on the council,
                            <strong>Vice President for Communications</strong>, where the Governor's Cup began to
                            include a
                            a rubric that would allow for the <strong>district officers themselves</strong> to score the
                            top
                            chatpers in our district, and I worked to create workshops that centered on member wellness,
                            mental
                            health,
                            and how to create inclusive, welcoming environments for all. I am proud to call the North
                            Central
                            District home, and
                            to help it grow and thrive.

                    <p class="frat">I am also passionate about music and the arts. I have been involved in music for as
                        long
                        as
                        I can remember, whether it was starting band in 5th grade, or singing in the church choice.
                        I believe that music is a powerful tool for bringing people together. In the past, I have been a
                        member
                        of
                        the <strong>Medina County Community Band</strong>, one of the oldest community bands in the
                        United States, as well as singing in the choir for several years at the <strong>Annunciation
                            Greek Orthodox Church</strong> in Akron, Ohio</strong>. While I am currently in the
                        beautiful
                        chaos
                        that is
                        raising young children, I hope to someday soon join my community band, and continue to grow as a
                        musician.
                        I want to help promote music and the appreciation of music within Kappa Kappa Psi, and
                        I want to push our organization grow and thrive musically in the future.</p>
