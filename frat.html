                    <h2>The Active Years</h2>
                    <p>I am a proud member of the <strong> Zeta Omicron chapter </strong> of Kappa Kappa Psi at the University of Akron, which
                    I joined in the spring of 2007. While at Akron, I served as the <strong> Vice President for Service, Alumni Relations
                    Officer, and Chapter President </strong>. During my undergraduate studies, I also served as the <strong> Chair of the Joint
                    Publications Committee </strong> at the 2009 North Central District Convention, and as 
                    <strong> North Central District President </strong> from 2010 to 2011. On the National level, I held the positions of <strong> Chair of the
                    Ritual and Regalia Committee </strong> in 2009 and <strong> Chair of the History and Traditions Committee </strong>
                    in 2011. During my time as an Active student, I also had the opportunity to attend the 2010 Northeast and Southwest
                    District Conventions, where I got to reconnect with the Brothers I had met at National Convention in 2009, as well as
                    make new connections. Many of the relationships I now have with Brothers <strong> started with an observer‚Äôs admiration
                    for their leadership </strong>, as I asked them questions about how they achieved their success and how I could
                    continue to grow as a leader myself. I am proud to say that many of these Brothers are still my close friends, whom I
                    still look up to, and <strong> call upon openly when I need advice or support </strong>, as our Ritual calls for us to
                    do.

                    <h2>The Early Alumni Years</h2>
                    <p>After graduating with degrees in Adolescent Young Adult (grades 7-12) Social Studies Education and History from UA, I
                    continued to <strong> seek out ways to serve both my community and the Fraternity </strong>. It was also during this
                    time that I moved to North Carolina to begin my teaching career. The first opportunity to serve came in 2013 when I was
                    asked to assist the petitioning group as their advisor. During the 2013-2014 academic school year, I served as Advisor
                    to the group at <strong>Elizabeth City State University </strong> in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, on their way to
                    being installed as the <strong>Nu Iota </strong>Chapter. It was during this time <strong> I provided feedback to
                        National Vice President Jack D. Lee, about the petitioning group process and ways in which I felt it could be
                        improved </strong>, such as not relying on neighboring chapters to provide instruction on the Fraternity's lessons
                    or perform the Ritual (as was the previous standard), as it proved to be an unfair burden to ask chapters who were not
                    immediately nearby.</p>
                </div>
                <p> In 2014, my husband Preston and I moved back home to Ohio, where I continued my career as a social studies teacher.
                During this time, I also continued to coach high school softball and began coaching girls' soccer, which allowed me to
                continue to build my leadership skills and <strong>work with students outside of the classroom to develop their athletic
                    and leadership skills </strong>. During my teaching career, I earned a Master of Arts Degree in History, and I have
                become certified in two additional teaching areas, Computer Science and Career and Technical Workforce Development in
                the field of Business Information Systems. My programming skills are a direct result of being a <strong>self-starter and
                    learning on my own through trial and error</strong>, as well as attending in-person and online workshops and coding
                boot camps. <strong>I believe that by actively pursuing new understanding and embracing opportunities for
                    self-improvement, we can collectively elevate our capabilities and contribute more significantly to our shared
                    goals. <em>It is my hope that this passion for learning becomes a contagious spirit, inspiring each Brother to
                        embark on their own journey of intellectual and personal development, ultimately strengthening our Brotherhood
                        as a whole</em> </strong>.

                        <p> In 2016, I was asked to serve as the <strong>North Central District Governor</strong>. I was honored to be asked to
                        serve in this capacity, and I took my role very seriously. It was during my seven-year tenure as North Central District
                        Governor that a new position was created on the council, <strong>Vice President for Communications </strong>, where the
                        Governor's Cup began to include a rubric that would allow for the <strong>district officers themselves to score the top
                            chapters in our district</strong>, and I worked to create workshops that centered on member wellness, mental health,
                        and how to create inclusive, welcoming environments for all. <strong> I am proud to call the North Central District home
                        </strong>, and to help it grow and thrive.

                            <p>In 2019, I began serving on the <strong>National Curriculum Development Committee </strong>, first as a committee
                            member, and then as the <strong>Committee Chair</strong> for the 2021-2023 biennium. During my time on the committee, a
                            project that I am proud to have initiated was the <strong>chapter activity database </strong>. This project not only
                            tapped into my technical knowledge but also my passion for making sure students have more resources on how to host and
                            develop meaningful membership activities. The creation of this database is a direct result of the many conversations
                            held with Active members in the North Central District during my tenure as Governor. In addition, during my time as
                            chair, two new lessons for the Road to Wisdom were developed: <strong> <em>Our Diversity Matters </em> </strong>and
                            <strong> <em>Our Sisters Matter</em> </strong>. While these lessons were passed along to the National Council, at the
                            time there was not a publications manager at National Headquarters to make final edits. <strong>One of the goals I would
                                like to achieve as VPME is to work with the National Council to ensure that these lessons are published and made
                                available to all chapters. </strong>

                    <h2>Music is the Touchstone</h2>
                    <p>At the heart of everything I‚Äôve done as a Brother, and the reason I wanted to be one in the first place, is my passion
                    for music and the arts, as well as my drive to continue to reach my maximum potential. I have been involved in music for
                    as long as I can remember, whether it was starting band in 5th grade as a flute player, singing in the church choir,
                    playing my horn in a concert setting, or participating in the athletic bands at UA with a hand-me-down saxophone.
                    <strong>I believe that music is a powerful tool for bringing people together </strong>. In the past, I have been a
                    member of the <strong>Medina County Community Band</strong>, one of the oldest community bands in the United States, as
                    well as singing in the choir for several years at the <strong>Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church</strong> in Akron,
                    Ohio. While I am currently in the beautiful chaos that is raising two young children, I hope to someday soon join my
                    community band, and <strong>continue to grow as a musician</strong>. I want to help promote music and the appreciation
                    of music within Kappa Kappa Psi, and I want to push our organization to grow and thrive musically in the future.</p>
