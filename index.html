        <p>👋🏽 Hello, I am</p>
        <h1>Tammi Ramsey</h1>
        <h2>Front-end Developer👩🏼‍💻and Computer Science Teacher👩🏼‍🏫 </h2>
        <h2 class="mb-4">based in the United States</h2>

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a developing front-end developer, historian, and teacher. This page is specifically
        designed for students to have a demo project for their senior portfolio for my 
    Career Tech courses. I am currently learning more about UX Design, Game Design, and Cybersecurity.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Professional Information</h2>
    <p>I currently teach at Sylvania Northview High school, and it is my second year at the school.
        As part of my Career Tech program, I also serve as a chapter advisor for Business Professionals
        of America (BPA).
        Before becoming a Wildcat, I taught a variety of social studies courses and computer science for eight years at Washington High School 
        in Washington Court House, Ohio. Prior to that, I taught one year of high school history and one year 
        of middle school social studies in southeastern North Carolina. I try to bring my drive for student development and love of learning
        into my classroom every day.
    </p>
    <p>
        I currently hold teaching credntials in several areas: Adolescent Young-Adult Seconday Social Studies (grades 7-12),
        Computer Information Science (grades P-12), and Career Technical Workforce Development
        in the area of Business and Information Services (grades K-12). I hold two Bachelor's Degrees from
        The University of Akron in Secondary Social Studies Education (BS) and History (BA), a Master's Degree
        in History (MA) from Slippery Rock University, and Graduate Certificates from Bowling Green State University
        in Computer Science Education and Career Technical Workforce Development.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Personal Life</h2>
    <p>Outside of teaching, I enjoy reading, knitting, yoga, gardening, cooking, biking, and spending time with
        my family. My husband, Preston, and I have been married since 2014, and have two small children and one awesome rescue dog. 
        I volunteer my time with Kappa Kappa Psi, National Honorary Band Fraternity, where I have served in a variety of leadership roles since I was an undergraduate student. 
        I am a Life Member of both Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma, National Honorary Sorority.
    </p>
